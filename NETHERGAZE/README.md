# NETHERGAZE

A computer vision project for real-time marker detection and augmented reality overlay rendering.

## Project Overview

NETHERGAZE is a computer vision system that detects markers in video streams and renders virtual overlays in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time marker detection (ArUco markers)
- Camera pose estimation
- Virtual overlay rendering
- Video input processing
- User interface for interaction and control

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the demo: `python examples/run_demo.py`

## Usage

The main entry point is `src/main.py` which orchestrates the complete pipeline.

## Project Goals

- Implement robust marker detection algorithms
- Achieve real-time performance for camera pose estimation
- Create seamless virtual overlay rendering
- Provide an intuitive user interface
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility
